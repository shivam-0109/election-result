# election-result

An election is contested by 5 candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and the voting
is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper. To automate the process,
assume the numbers on the ballot papers are stored in a single dimensional array. Write a
program to read the numbers in the array and find the candidate who won the election
